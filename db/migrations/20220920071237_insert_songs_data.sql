 'Round and 'round, I'm caught up in this swirl
 Tryna dig in, tryna burrow
 Pressure turned this stone into a pearl

 Sugar-coated like a churro

 Done extending out my arm
 Made a lot of money from my poems
 Been around and now they say I'm on

 Treat that money like an addict, it's a habit, I'm a fiend
 Feeling that rush, rocket ready to launch, hands up ready and gone, been waiting too long
 Trust, done plenty that's wrong
 Old me's dead and that's gone, thank God I'm headstrong

 I gotta save me from myself
 This emptiness, it hurts like hell
 My good intentions let me down (Down, down, down)
 I keep getting in my way
 My stubborn pride will dig my grave
 Leave behind with every step I take, yeah

 I just realized
 I've built walls a mile high
 To protect my heart
 But now I'm all alone stuck on the inside
 The heart doesn't need a castle, it needs a bridge
 Been so scared that I'd unravel
 

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Brick by brick, I built these walls
 Now I know that I am strong
 Just watch me tear them down
 I'm gonna tear them down
 

 [Chorus]
 If it couldn't break your heart
 Is it really, is it really love?
 If it can't tear you apart
 Is it really, is it really love?
 Just watch me march towards the battle
 I'm gonna tear down this castle
 I'm gonna tear down this castle

 I criticized
 Myself for trusting lies
 I know I can't hide
 'Cause then I'd be alone stuck on the inside
 The heart doesn't need a castle, it needs a bridge
 Been so scared that I'd unravel

 Now I know that I'm enough

 I get lost sometimes and I can't seem to find the light
 Between the walls I've built for myself right in my mind
 And than you came over and you showed me love
 That I never had seen before

 And you can lift me off the ground
